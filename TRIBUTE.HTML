            <h2>About the Legend</h2>
            <p>
                Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, known as the "Missile Man of India," 
                was one of the most beloved presidents and scientists of India. 
                He played a crucial role in India's civilian space program and military missile development. 
                His simplicity, humility, and dedication made him a role model for millions.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Dr. Kalam’s journey from 
                a small-town boy to the President of India is truly inspiring. 
                He always believed in the power of dreams and hard work, famously saying, 
                <em>"Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action."</em>
